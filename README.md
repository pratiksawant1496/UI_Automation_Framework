# UI Automation Framework

## 📌 Project Overview
The project was developed to strengthen test automation skills using the Selenium framework with Java, applying knowledge gained from a Udemy course. The target application is a website intentionally designed for automated testing practice. Within the project, 26 automated tests have been implemented, each based on test cases provided by the site’s developers. Upon execution, the tests can be run with the appropriate command to generate a comprehensive report. This report details the actions performed during testing and clearly presents the status of each test case

The framework supports:
- Automated functional UI test cases.
- Cross-browser execution.
- parallel execution with Selenium Grid
- Reporting with detailed logs and test results.
- CI/CD integration with Jenkins and Docker.

## 🎨 Design Pattern
The framework follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern:
- Each web page is represented as a **class**.
- Page elements are defined as **variables**.
- Actions on the page are implemented as **methods**.
- Test classes interact with page objects, ensuring **separation of concerns** and **reusability**.

This structure makes the framework easy to maintain and extend when new features or pages are added.

---

## 📊 Reporting
The framework integrates with **Extent Reports** (or Allure Reports, depending on configuration):
- Generates **HTML reports** with detailed test execution results.
- Includes **screenshots** for failed test cases.
- Provides **logs** for debugging and traceability.
- Reports are stored in the `reports/` directory after execution.

Example report features:
- Test case status (Pass/Fail/Skip).
- Execution time.
- Browser/environment details.
- Visual charts for quick analysis.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pratiksawant1496/UI_Automation_Framework.git
cd UI_Automation_Framework
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have **Java (JDK 8+)** and **Maven** installed. Then run:
```bash
mvn clean install
```

### 3. Run Tests
Execute the TestNG suite:
```bash
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testing.xml
```

Reports will be generated automatically in the `reports/` folder.
In order to generate Allure Report:

Install Allure Commandline: npm install -g allure-commandline --save-dev

Generate report: allure serve target/allure-results

---

## ⚙️ Configuration
- **testing.xml**: Defines which test classes to run.  
- **pom.xml**: Contains dependencies (Selenium, TestNG, Extent Reports, etc.).  
- **docker-compose.yaml**: Enables containerized test execution.  
- **Jenkinsfile**: Automates test runs in CI/CD pipelines.  

---

## 📊 CI/CD Integration
- **Jenkins**: Pipeline defined in `Jenkinsfile` for automated builds and test execution.  
- **Docker**: Supports containerized test environments for consistent execution.  
- **Reports**: Automatically published after test runs for easy access.
